<b><p>This year has been marked with reflection and change. Some days feel good and others feel strange. We’ve learned to work differently. We try to tune out the stress but sometimes life still feels like a mess. Learn new skills that we thought we never could. We find ways to travel to less congested places and we meet our friends with covered faces. Hopefully this year has been filled with opportunity and we’ve tried to exercise and strengthen our immunity. 2020 hasn’t been like we expected but we’ve found new ways to stay connected and worry less about the very small chores. Things will get better because they usually do. Enjoy what you love and learn something new. Don’t forget to pray and always be kind and try to stay positive and learn to unwind.</b></p>

<font color="White"><font size="100"><h4>RELEVANCE OF THE DRAWING</font></h4>
<b><p>The social justice has sometimes given us hope, in terms of giving justice to those who aren't given one. Though our social justice system is corrupt that as long as you have wealth, you have the authority to get awaty with everything. This is why the PH politicians protects the corrupt justice system that they've promised to eradicate because as long as you have wealth and power, you have the authority to get away with everything that you can get away from. But it sometimes gave us hope because some victims received the justice that they deserved.</b></p>
